# SC2002-CAMS

## Team Composition
SCMC Group 3 comprises of Jace Seow Wen Hui, Kumar Janaki, Lee Jia Xin Mildred and Sunkara Bhargavi.

## Program Functionality
We have implemented all the necessary functions for all domains, Student, Staff and Committee, in our CAMS program. We sincerely hope you would enjoy using our meticulously crafted program! :)

## Feature Enhancements
**Reflection**: The Mappable interface facilitated automatic conversion of object properties to and from key-value pairs, allowing for flexible and scalable handling of diverse class structures during runtime. This approach streamlined the codebase, enabling a more adaptable and extensible system architecture. </br>

**Factory Design Pattern**: Generate requests swiftly based on different requirements, enhancing system scalability and adaptability.</br>

**Generic Repository Class**: Repository<Model> class with generics allows for flexible data storage and retrieval for any model type, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.</br>

**Template Method Pattern**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses alter specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.</br>

**Strategy Design Pattern**: The TXTReportGenerator class defines a family of algorithms for different types of reports (performance report, attendee list, committee list, student list), encapsulates them, and allows them to be used interchangeably.</br>

**ID Lookup**: If a user forgets her userID for login to the system, she can retrieve it by providing her username.

**Password Encryption**: SHA-3 algorithm to provide improved security.</br>

**Cultivation of Good Cyber Hygiene**: Enforced a minimum of 8 characters for password</br>

**Exception Handling**: Multiple classes for exceptions i.e. ModelNotFound, PageBack</br>

**Note to Students**: Reminding them about their restrictions before they proceed to use the program.</br>

**Automatic Page Redirection**: Committee attempting to login to the student account will be redirected to the committee page for extra privileged access.</br>

**Automatic Rejection Filter**: Staff can choose to reject all suggestions at once, after approving their desired suggestions</br>

**Enquiry Report Generation**: Staff can generate a report with the list of enquiries and their corresponding replies.</br>

**User-friendliness and Real-life Considerations**: The console user interface was designed to be neat, informative and visually appealing, even with various colours.</br>

**User Convenience**: Incorporated camp IDs to differentiate between different camps</br>
